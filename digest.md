## [Synapse-specific and plasticity-regulated AMPA receptor mobility tunes synaptic integration](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(25)00931-6?rss=yes)
*Neuron*  
Score: **0.80**

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Short-term plasticity (STP) filters synaptic inputs across rapid timescales. Nowacka et al. show that postsynaptic AMPAR desensitization and diffusion-trapping, shaped by auxiliary subunits and activity-dependent signaling, generate synapse-specific gain control. By broadening temporal filtering and adjusting short-term depression, receptor mobility emerges as a central regulator of circuit information processing.

## [Gaussian Process Inference Reveals Non-separability of Positionand Velocity Tuning in Grid Cells](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.02.703269v1?rss=1)
*bioRxiv*  
Score: **0.75**

This study utilizes neural recordings to investigate the complex dynamics of grid cells, linking to interests in neuronal timescales and computational methods.

<details>
<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) support spatial navigation by responding to multiple variables, including position, speed, and head direction. While tuning curves for each of these variables has been examined individually at the level of single-cells, less is known about the conjunctive coding of grid cells for these properties. To investigate this, we analyzed neural recordings of freely foraging rats and constructed four-dimensional (4D) tuning curves across 2D position and 2D vel…

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

<p>The brain can be conceptualized as a control system facilitating transitions between states, such as from rest to motor activity. Applying network control theory to measurements of brain signals enables characterization of brain dynamics through control properties. However, most prior studies that have applied network control theory have evaluated brain dynamics under unperturbed conditions, neglecting the critical role of external perturbations in accurate system identification. In this stud…

<p>Neuronal ensembles, which represent coordinated activity patterns within individual brain regions, play crucial roles in memory. While local ensembles dynamically change in response to experience, factors influencing the stability of neuronal ensemble compositions remain largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the dynamics of neuronal ensembles in the prelimbic cortex layer 5 (PL5), basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA), and ventral hippocampus CA1 region (vCA1) during conditioning, e…

## [Neural integrator and orchestrator communities shape spontaneous signaling in the human brain](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.04.703687v1?rss=1)
*bioRxiv*  
Score: **0.40**

Tags: neural_dynamics, integration

Discusses intrinsic brain dynamics and hierarchical architecture in neural signaling, which may involve elements of oscillations or neuronal communication aligned with neural timescales.

<details>
<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Understanding how intrinsic brain dynamics are organized is critical for explaining human cognition and sensory processing. Theoretical frameworks propose a hierarchical architecture in which some neural systems act as orchestrators, broadcasting information across the brain, whereas others serve as integrators, transforming incoming signals. Here, we quantitatively test whether this orchestration-integration framework is embedded in intrinsic brain activity, that is, in the absence of explicit …
