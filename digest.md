Tags: chronic pain, CGIC, neuropathic

This study identifies the caudal granular insular cortex as a crucial area for pain chronification, offering insights into neuropathic pain mechanisms.

<details>
<summary>RSS summary</summary>

<p>Allodynia (perceiving touch as painful) is an enduring symptom of neuropathic pain. While acute pain is initiated by afferent signaling from the periphery to spinal cord, pain chronification recruits ongoing activity in supraspinal sites. One such site that has been proposed to be important in pain chronification is the caudal granular insular cortex (CGIC). The present studies of allodynia in response to sciatic nerve injury in male and female rats focus on the role of CGIC in pain chronific…

## [Contributions from Long-Term Memory Explain Superior Visual Working Memory Performance with Meaningful Objects](http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/46/5/e1660252025?rss=1)
*Journal of Neuroscience current issue*  
Score: **0.90**  
Published: 2026-02-04T17:30:29+00:00
Tags: memory, visual cognition, interference

The study reveals that long-term memory enhances visual working memory performance by reducing proactive interference with meaningful objects.

<details>
<summary>RSS summary</summary>

<p>Working memory (WM) capacity has been claimed to be larger for meaningful objects than for simple features, possibly because richer semantic representations enhance item distinctiveness. However, prior demonstrations compared trial-unique meaningful objects with a small set of repeated simple features. This design confounds meaningfulness with proactive interference (PI), such that PI is minimal for trial-unique objects but substantial for repeated features. Therefore, superior performance fo…

## [Distinct Mechanisms for Panoramic and Landmark-Based View Integration in Human Place-Selective Cortex](http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/46/5/e0187252025?rss=1)
*Journal of Neuroscience current issue*  
Score: **0.80**  
Published: 2026-02-04T17:30:28+00:00
Tags: spatial cognition, cortex, navigation

The research differentiates the neural processes for integrating panoramic and landmark-based views, important for understanding spatial navigation.

<details>
<summary>RSS summary</summary>

<p>To encode a cognitive map of an environment, a navigator must be able to integrate across perceptual views corresponding to the same place. This can be done in two ways: first, by integrating across the panorama of views obtainable at a single vantage point, and second, by integrating across views of a distal location containing a landmark that is visible from multiple vantage points. We tested the hypothesis that these two viewpoint integration processes are mediated by different neuroanatom…

Tags: brain dynamics, network control, perturbation

This paper applies network control theory to examine brain dynamics, highlighting the role of external perturbations in system identification.

<details>
<summary>RSS summary</summary>

<p>The brain can be conceptualized as a control system facilitating transitions between states, such as from rest to motor activity. Applying network control theory to measurements of brain signals enables characterization of brain dynamics through control properties. However, most prior studies that have applied network control theory have evaluated brain dynamics under unperturbed conditions, neglecting the critical role of external perturbations in accurate system identification. In this stud…

## [Connectomes across temporal scales with simultaneous wide-field optical imaging and resting-state functional MRI](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.01.703149v1?rss=1)

Tags: connectomes, rs-fMRI, temporal scales, imaging

Innovative combination of rs-fMRI and wide-field optical imaging to address the challenge of hemodynamic delay, offering a new perspective on neural connectivity across timescales.

<details>
<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a cornerstone of human brain research, yet its interpretation is complicated by its sensitivity to the slow hemodynamic response that obscures the organization of neural activity across faster time scales. Here we use simultaneous wide-field optical imaging (WOI) and rs-fMRI to directly examine the relationship between neural and hemodynamic functional connectomes across time scales. We show that much of the large-scale spatial structure is preserved acr…

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Sensory processing relies on an intricate interplay between specialized sensory circuits and the broader brain. Leveraging the whole-brain Drosophila melanogaster connectome, we analyzed long-range projections linking the optic lobe (OL)--the principal visual center--reciprocally with the central brain and the contralateral OL to determine how visual features are computed by a brainwide network. By quantifying synaptic polarity and connectivity, we classified the projection neurons into feedforw…

## [Distinct activation thresholds of unmyelinated C-fiber afferents by dorsal root ganglion and peripheral nerve stimulation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.02.703367v1?rss=1)

The findings show different thresholds for C-fiber activation, which could inform pain management strategies.

<details>
<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Objectives: Sensitization of C-fiber nociceptors plays a critical role in spontaneous and ongoing pain in patients with chronic pain. We recently demonstrated that C-fiber afferents can be reversibly blocked through activity-dependent conduction slowing, suggesting that selective activation of C-fiber afferents may represent a novel strategy for pain relief. We hypothesized that electrical peripheral nerve stimulation (ePNS) and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation exhibit distinct activation …

<p>by Gaurav Sharma, Bernard Marius ’t Hart, Jean-Jacques Orban de Xivry, Denise Y.P. Henriques, Mireille E. Broucke</p> A fundamental problem of visuomotor adaptation research is to understand how the brain is capable to asymptotically remove a predictable exogenous disturbance from a visual error signal using limited sensor information by re-calibration of hand movement. From a control theory perspective, the most striking aspect of this problem is that it falls squarely in the realm of the in…
