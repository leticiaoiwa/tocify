<div><p>Direct-ink writing (DIW) has rapidly become a versatile 3D fabrication method due to its ability to deposit a wide range of complex fluids into customizable 3D geometries. This review highlights key fundamental fluid mechanics and soft matter challenges across the different stages of the DIW printing process. The rheology of fluids and suspensions governs the flow behavior through narrow nozzles, posing questions about extrudability, confined flow dynamics, and clogging mechanisms. Downs…

Author(s): Sihang Liu, Ran Gao, Shuai Yin, Zhi Tao, Haiwang Li, and Yi Huang<br /><p>Droplet impact on liquid pools has long been analyzed using energy-balance models dominated by inertial and gravitational effects. In the low-Froude-number regime relevant to immiscible droplet encapsulation and interfacial processing, however, the partitioning of impact energy remains poorly understood. Here we show experimentally that, alongside gravitational potential energy, surface energy and viscous dissip…

Author(s): Fumiya Tokoro, Hideki Takayama, Shinji Deguchi, Andreas Zöttl, and Daiki Matsunaga<br /><p>How do planar beating microswimmers discover efficient swimming gaits under local energetic limits? Using reinforcement learning on a discretized bead–bend–spring filamentous microswimmer with locally constrained torques, we reveal emergent waveforms (frequency, amplitude, wavelength) set by a three-way competition between active torques, elastic stiffness, and the action-update interval. Our wo…

Author(s): Ming Hong, Beichen Tian, Qin Wu, and Biao Huang<br /><p>Cavitation around marine propellers operating in nonuniform wake flows spans multiple spatial and temporal scales, yet its relationship to pressure pulsations is poorly understood. This study integrates pressure measurements with high-speed imaging and digital inline holography to resolve the evolution from large-scale sheet cavities and vortex tubes to intermediate-scale cloud clusters and microbubbles. We show that distinct cav…

Author(s): Mengfan Xu, Bowen Zhu, Zhanzhou Hao, and Bo Yin<br /><p>Inspired by stiffness modulation in biological fish and advances in smart materials, we study the propulsion of a self-propelled swimmer with spatially nonuniform and dynamically varying stiffness. We demonstrate how different stiffness modulation strategies affect swimming performance and internal actuation requirements. By introducing a cycle-averaged equivalent stiffness, the required actuation strength can be consistently sca…

Author(s): Xander M. de Wit, Hessel J. Adelerhof, André Freitas, Rudie P. J. Kunnen, Herman J. H. Clercx, and Federico Toschi<br /><p>We study homogeneous isotropic turbulence laden with a very large number of small bubbles. Using an efficient four-way coupled point-particle method, this work quantifies when and how bubble–bubble interactions and feedback on the fluid become relevant. While the back-reaction of microbubbles leaves the turbulent energy budget largely unchanged under typical circu…

Author(s): Yi Zhang, Apurav Tambe, and Zhao Pan<br /><p>The maximum droplet volume that a fiber can retain is a classic problem in the physics of droplet-fiber interactions, with established results for horizontal and Λ-shaped bent fibers. However, this question has remained less explored for V-shaped bent fibers, despite their relevance to fog harvesting and condensation technologies. Here, we develop a free-energy- based analytical model to predict the maximum droplet volume on V-shaped fibers…
