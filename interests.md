## scoring block
Scoring calibration:
Score ≥ 0.80 ONLY if the item clearly involves electrophysiology or physiological time series
  (EEG/MEG/LFP/iEEG/ECoG/neuronal spiking) OR aperiodic/1/f, oscillations, waveform shape,
  spectral parameterization, or neuronal timescales — OR introduces a general time-series/signal
  processing method that would transfer to those data.

If it is primarily about drugs/behavior/psychiatric symptoms without neural/physio time-series analysis,
  cap score at 0.40.

If it is primarily microbiology/immunology/metabolism/genetics without neural dynamics methods,
  cap score at 0.25. -->

## narrative
The scientific investigation into the fluid mechanics of open cavities has transitioned over the last century from a focus on the acoustic resonances of musical instruments to the mitigation of complex aeroacoustic and structural challenges in modern aerospace and maritime vehicles. The interaction between a boundary layer and a geometric surface discontinuity, such as a square open cavity, generates a self-sustaining oscillatory field that remains one of the most persistent hurdles in engineering design.1 In high-speed aircraft, these cavities—often manifesting as landing gear bays or weapon release systems—are sources of intense acoustic tones that can reach levels up to 190 dB, potentially inducing structural fatigue, interference with sensitive instrumentation, and catastrophic fluid-elastic modes such as flutter.1 More recently, the focus has expanded to encompass hydrodynamic applications and small-scale vehicles where efficiency and stealth are paramount.1 To address these challenges, researchers have increasingly turned to biomimetics, specifically the morphological adaptations of the barn owl , whose evolution has prioritized near-silent flight for nocturnal hunting.
